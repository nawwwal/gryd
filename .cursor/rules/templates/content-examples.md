### Article Opening
```markdown
# rebuilding the messenger interface

*a teardown of facebook messenger's conversation flow,
with notes on what breaks when you scale to 1.3 billion users*

messenger looks simple. you open it, see your conversations,
tap one, start typing. but underneath that simplicity is a
system handling edge cases most designers never think about...

## the problem nobody talks about

when someone sends you a message while you're typing,
what happens to your draft? most apps get this wrong.
messenger gets it right, but only after years of iteration...
```

### Technical Deep-Dive Section
```markdown
## implementation notes

the typing indicator isn't just a simple websocket event.
it's throttled, debounced, and includes presence logic:

```typescript
const useTypingIndicator = () => {
  const [isTyping, setIsTyping] = useState(false)
  const debouncedTyping = useDebounce(isTyping, 1000)

  // send typing events max once per 3 seconds
  const throttledSend = useThrottle(sendTypingEvent, 3000)

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isTyping) throttledSend()
  }, [isTyping])
}
```

why the complexity? because at scale, every optimization matters.
with 1.3 billion users, even small inefficiencies compound.
```

### Last Word Reflection
```markdown
## last word

the best interfaces feel effortless precisely because
someone spent months obsessing over details you never notice.
messenger's success isn't in what it shows you—it's in
what it chooses to hide.
```

### Honest Commentary
```markdown
# broken: a color picker that picks the wrong colors

*started as a weekend project to understand color theory.
ended up proving i don't understand color theory.*

the goal was simple: build a color picker that suggests
harmonious color combinations. the reality is messier.

## what works
- the interface is clean and responsive
- drag interactions feel smooth
- color wheel rendering is accurate

## what doesn't work
- the harmony suggestions are mathematically correct but visually terrible
- accessibility contrast calculations are off by ~15%
- somehow i broke the hex input validation

## lessons learned
color theory is harder than css animations.
much harder.

## About Editor Example

### Personal + Professional Blend
```markdown
# about the editor

aditya nawal — product designer with an engineer's mind
and an artist's eye

currently building design systems at [company],
previously at [previous company] where i learned that
good design dies in bad processes.

## what i care about

not chasing design trends. studying why things fail
when money's on the line. finding the edges where
systems break and users get frustrated.

i write about design failures, forgotten interaction
patterns, and the quiet wins that nobody talks about.

## what i'm working on

- design system archaeology: documenting patterns
  that worked before we forgot why
- prototype graveyard: failed experiments that
  taught me something useful
- edge case collection: the weird scenarios that
  break every interface

## availability

open to interesting problems. not interested in
making landing pages or redesigning logos.

currently: available for short-term consulting
next year: maybe full-time, maybe not
