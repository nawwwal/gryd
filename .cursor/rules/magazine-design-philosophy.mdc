# THE GRYD Design Philosophy

## Core Philosophy
THE GRYD is not a website. It is a living magazine:
- "typeset in old ink, warped by scroll, textured by light"
- "built like an archive, dressed like a relic, coded like a contraption"
- "maximalism with purpose â€” if it moves, it should feel hand-built"

## Design Principles

### Tactile UI
Every element should have surface, shadow, or slip:
```css
/* Example tactile interaction */
.magazine-element {
  transition: all 0.2s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
  transform-origin: center;
}

.magazine-element:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px) scale(1.02);
  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
}
```

### Slow Reading
Let people read, not just scroll:
- Use generous spacing and comfortable line-height
- Limit text width to 65ch for optimal reading
- Implement reading progress indicators
- Hide navigation during scroll to reduce distractions

### Layout as Voice
Use whitespace and weight to speak:
- Drop caps for section beginnings
- Generous gutters for breathing room
- Vertical rhythm with consistent spacing
- Magazine-style grid with proper column proportions

### Forgotten Archive
Feel like you stumbled into a design relic:
- Paper grain overlays and texture effects
- Ink aging and sepia filters on hover
- Folded corner animations
- Blend modes for authentic print feel

## Visual Language

### Typography System
```css
/* Headlines - Platypi SC 700 */
font-family: 'Platypi', serif;
font-weight: 700;
text-transform: uppercase;
letter-spacing: -0.02em;

/* Body - Fraunces */
font-family: 'Fraunces', serif;
font-size: 1.125rem;
line-height: 1.7;

/* Code - JetBrains Mono */
font-family: 'JetBrains Mono', monospace;
font-size: 0.875rem;
```

### Color Palette
```css
:root {
  --gryd-bg: #fafafa;      /* Paper white */
  --gryd-text: #111111;    /* Ink black */
  --gryd-soft: #666666;    /* Faded text */
  --gryd-accent: #d97706;  /* Editorial orange */
}
```

### Surface Textures
- **Paper grain overlays**: SVG filters or canvas shaders
- **Layering blend modes**: multiply, overlay effects for depth
- **Faux crease lines**: radial gradients for paper feel
- **Folded corner animations**: on hover interactions

## Success Metrics
The magazine is successful when:
- Someone reads a whole project page, then DMs about a footnote
- A recruiter says "wait, this is a real magazine?"
- Someone prints a PDF and pins it on their wall
- Someone remembers how it felt to scroll

## Interactive Effects
Maximalist but purposeful animations:
- Scroll-linked animations via scroll-timeline
- Dynamic smudge trails on hover
- Parallax inkblot backgrounds for depth
- Typewriter reveal for headings
- Noise layer glitch for external links
- Opacity flicker for faded ink effect
