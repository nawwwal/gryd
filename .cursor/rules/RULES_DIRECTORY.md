## üîÑ Rule Activation Strategy

The AI agent should request rules based on:

1. **File Context**: Automatically consider rules based on current file location
2. **Question Type**: Match question intent to relevant rule descriptions
3. **Technical Domain**: Include domain-specific rules (React, CSS, CMS, etc.)
4. **Project Phase**: Development vs. deployment vs. content creation
5. **Complexity**: Simple questions may need fewer rules, complex issues may need multiple

### Example Activation Scenarios

**Creating a new React component:**
- `component-standards.mdc` (primary)
- `magazine-design-philosophy.mdc` (design guidance)
- `styling-system.mdc` (if styling involved)

**Mobile optimization question:**
- `mobile-optimization.mdc` (primary)
- `performance-optimization.mdc` (performance aspects)
- `component-standards.mdc` (component patterns)

**Content management workflow:**
- `content-workflows.mdc` (primary)
- `sanity-cms-setup.mdc` (CMS aspects)
- `content-strategy.mdc` (editorial guidance)

## üìä Rule Metrics

- **Total Rules**: 11 agent-requested + 1 manual
- **Average Rule Size**: ~200-350 lines (optimized, well under 500-line target)
- **Template Files**: 10 reference implementations
- **Coverage Areas**: Design, Development, Content, Performance, Mobile, CMS
- **Overlap Status**: ‚úÖ Eliminated duplicated content across rules

## üîÑ Recent Refactoring (2024)

**Eliminated Content Overlap:**
- **Rich Content Blocks**: Moved detailed implementations to `@content-blocks`
- **Content Workflows**: Moved detailed processes to `@content-workflows`
- **Schema Patterns**: Moved development patterns to `@sanity-schemas`

**Improved Focus:**
- `sanity-cms-setup.mdc` ‚Üí CMS infrastructure and configuration
- `mdx-content-system.mdc` ‚Üí System architecture and integration
- Domain rules ‚Üí Specific implementation details

This distributed system ensures the AI gets precisely the right context for any question while maintaining THE GRYD's unique magazine aesthetic and technical standards.
