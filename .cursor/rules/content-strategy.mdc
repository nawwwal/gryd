# Content Strategy & Editorial Voice

## Editorial Philosophy
THE GRYD is edited by Aditya Nawal - Product Designer with engineer's mind and artist's eye:
- "Don't chase design trends. Study why things fail when money's on the line"
- Focus on system edges, broken flows, forgotten rules
- Talk honestly about failure, respect quiet design wins

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Voice & Tone
- **All lowercase**: except intentional all-uppercase/sentence case
- **Essay pacing**: slow, intentional, no filler words
- **Verb-driven titles**: every project starts with action
- **Reflective endings**: end every article with a 'last word' — one-line reflection

### Content Structure
```yaml
project_teardowns:
  format: "detailed teardowns (not case studies)"
  elements: [footnotes, pullquotes, technical deep-dives]
  approach: "write like a printed essay"

experiments:
  format: "live CSS toys, half-finished sketches, broken code playgrounds"
  voice: "honest about what's working and what's broken"

about_editor:
  format: "part résumé, part biography, part wandering letter"
  tone: "personal but professional, introspective"
```

## Magazine Sections

### Homepage
- Entry point with paper-folded animation
- Static hiss and editorial cut
- Featured project with compelling pull

### Work Section
- Detailed project teardowns with footnotes
- Technical implementation details
- Pullquotes for key insights
- "Last word" reflection at the end

### About Editor
- Personal story mixed with professional background
- Design philosophy and approach
- Current availability and interests

### Experiments
- Live CSS toys and interactive demos
- Half-finished sketches with honest commentary
- Broken code playgrounds with learning notes

## Button & Interaction Copy
Always use lowercase verbs for actions:
- "read this" instead of "Read More"
- "view experiment" instead of "View Project"
- "open issue" instead of "Contact"
- "explore work" instead of "Portfolio"

## Content Quality Standards

### Technical Content
- All code examples must be tested and functional
- Include context about why, not just how
- Explain failure modes and edge cases
- Provide links to working demos when possible

### Visual Content
- Images must be 1200px+ width minimum
- Always include descriptive alt text
- Use captions to provide additional context
- Optimize for both desktop and mobile viewing

### Editorial Standards
- Consistent voice across all content
- No filler content or placeholder text
- Every piece should teach something specific
- Maintain magazine's tactile, authentic feel

## Content Categories
```yaml
project_types:
  - photography: "visual exploration and technique"
  - code: "technical implementation and learning"
  - prototype: "experimental interfaces and interactions"
  - research: "deep dives into design problems"
  - visual: "aesthetic exploration and critique"
  - note: "quick thoughts and observations"

difficulty_levels:
  - beginner: "accessible to newcomers"
  - intermediate: "assumes some experience"
  - advanced: "requires domain expertise"
  - expert: "highly specialized knowledge"
```

## SEO & Discoverability
- Write compelling descriptions for each piece
- Use descriptive, action-oriented titles
- Include relevant tags without keyword stuffing
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Build content that people want to share
