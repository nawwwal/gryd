# The GRYD Magazine Portfolio

**The GRYD** is a digital magazine that doubles as Aditya Nawal's design portfolio. Every page is an interactive spread—part case study, part playbook, part playground.

## Features

- Gyroscopic hero section and magazine-style spreads
- Featured articles, rapid-fire interviews and editor picks
- "Letters to the Editor" contact area for project inquiries
- Custom footer with fun stats and editorial credits
- Built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and shadcn-ui

## Development

Install dependencies and start the local server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to explore the magazine.

## Production build

Generate an optimized build with:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output in `dist/` is ready to be deployed to any static host. A simple `vercel.json` is provided for Vercel deployments.
